# Raspberry Pi Headless installation

TLDR;
Continue if all you have are the following
 - raspberrypi
 - raspbian image
 - linux(ubuntu)
 - ethernet cable (LAN cable)
 - Internet (for installing required packages) 

# Intro
This tutorial is about how to ssh into your raspberry pi


### Download and install raspbian 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

### Enable ssh on Rapberry Pi
To enable SSH create an empty file named ssh, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card.
> **NOTE**: More info can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md)

### Setup dhcp server on linux
Now lets install dhcp server on your pc.
Doing this would allow your pc to lease an ip address to your raspberry pi,
when you connect the two via ethernet cable.

###### Installation
```shell
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

###### Configuration

First, we have to assign on what interfaces should the DHCP server (dhcpd) serve DHCP requests.

Edit file /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
```shell
sudo vi /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
```

Assign the network intrerface
```
INTERFACES="eth0"
```
> **NOTE** Check your interface name using **ifconfig** command. 
It could be something like eth0, eth1, eno1 etc. 

Save and close the file.


Now, edit dhcpd.conf file,
```shell
sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

Find and set the domain name and domain-name servers:
```
# option definitions common to all supported networks...
 option domain-name "somename.local";
 option domain-name-servers server.somename.local;
```
Next we Define the sunbet, range of ip addresses, domain and domain name servers like below:

```
# A slightly different configuration for an internal subnet.
 subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.20;
    option domain-name-servers server.somename.local;
    option domain-name "somename.local";
    option routers 192.168.0.1;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
    default-lease-time 600;
    max-lease-time 7200;
 }
```

#### Now restart the dhcp service 
```shell
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```
or In Ubuntu 14.04 and older systems:
```
sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart
```
Now connect your pc and pi via network cable

Go to your PC network connections

Edit the wired connection

Goto IPv4 settings

Change the method to Manual

Add the following address

|Address|Netmask|Gateway|
|-------|-------|-------|
|192.168.0.150|24|      |

Now you can find the IP Address of raspberry pi using 
```
ping raspberrypi.local  
```
If that fails use
```
more /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
```
To find the leases made by your server.

The output of the command will be something like this
```
# The format of this file is documented in the dhcpd.leases(5) manual page.
# This lease file was written by isc-dhcp-4.3.3

lease 192.168.0.20 {
  starts 6 2017/05/20 14:27:16;
  ends 6 2017/05/20 14:37:16;
  tstp 6 2017/05/20 14:37:16;
  cltt 6 2017/05/20 14:27:16;
  binding state active;
  next binding state free;
  rewind binding state free;
  hardware ethernet xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;
  set vendor-class-identifier = "dhcpcd-6.7.1:Linux-4.4.34-v7+:armv7l:BCM2709";
  client-hostname "raspberrypi";
  ...
}
```

Now login to your pi via ssh
```shell
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
or
```shell
ssh pi@192.168.0.20
```
Default password is **`raspberry`**
